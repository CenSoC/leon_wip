A very quick hack to automate mouse and keyboard input on Win (from here on 'lose') OS.

An important thing to remember is that some programs run at the admin level (e.g. some eye-tracker controlling software). If 'autoinput' runs as a normal user, then any input (mouse clicks, etc.) sent to windows of the admin-level program will be dropped/ignored by the system. So do set an appropriate 'run as' level of the utility before expecting it work properly.
