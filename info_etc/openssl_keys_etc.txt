openssl genrsa -aes256 -out key.pem 1024
openssl req -new -key key.pem -out request.pem
openssl x509 -req -days 11333 -in request.pem -signkey key.pem -out certificate.pem
# ... or if getting from authority $ openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.crt -out certificate.pem
openssl dhparam -outform PEM -out dh.pem 1024

set if using boost asio /openss with add_verify_path call, need to use
cd to clients_certificates and then run
c_rehash .

c_reshash is installed in custom build of openssl (as per custom_env builds)

see man SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations for more info

to view certificate info (useful when trying to find out if date has expired):

openssl x509 -text -in cert.pem

to print end date of the certificate
openssl x509 -startdate -enddate -noout -in certificate.pem

to convert certificate and key to a web-browser importable certificate (e.g. for web-browser to use as a client certificate):
openssl pkcs12 -export -out netcpu_client_certificate.p12 -inkey client_key.pem -in client_certificate.pem
