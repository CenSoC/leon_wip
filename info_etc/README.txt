As per previous (top-level) README -- the contents of this work are indeed "in progress" and so some (or many) of the explanations may be missing. The relevant explanations/configurations content will be added as time progresses.

Currently all of the content is largely in source form (e.g. .h, .cc, .sh etc), the binaries (.exe et. al.) are not distributed from the source repository. The documentation follows (largely, with few exceptions) the same principle: the .eps, .png, .pdf formats are mainly considered to be a compiled/binary format; whilst the .tex, .svg, .csv files are the sources. Consequently if one is only after the final/compiled files then one is free to build those from the sources herein, or download from some external location. Currentnly, there is one such location (no guarantee with respect its long term presence though):
