All of the higher-level README files apply.

Moreover, this is a QUICK HACK -- very EARLY DAYS and is intended to provide a PROOF-OF-CONCEPT only. 

Without a shadow of a doubt it is left for others to create, if so desired, more sleek/eye-candy/super-duper HTML5/Javascript interfaces. 

THE AUTHOR DOES NOT PLACE ANY CLAIMS ON HIS PROFFICIENCY/SKILLS/ETC. W.R.T. JAVASCRIPT/ECMA coding. 

Things like variable-scopes are not optimized for Javascript programming (and at times are "hacked" by immitating those from a C++ realm) -- this, however, shall suffice for the proof-of-concept interface implementation (esp. given that such Javascript hacking was picked-up on the "need-to-have-a-HTML-button-here" kind of basis). This may also lead to a larger code-base (all these 'this.pid.' et al are in many cases not needed and may be cleaned up later on). Indubitably. 

The http-based ++c processing could, however, act as a segway to future survey-providing -taking technology to be developed "inhouse".

There may be a need to install a third party library. 
Currently such lib(s) is/are:
zip.js (tested with JZlib version : "1.0.2") such a lib (namely parts thereof: deflate.js and zip.js) was placed in third_party/zip directory within http directory, but this is strictly is not compulsory and may indeed be changed depending on the sysadmin installation/deployment context.
