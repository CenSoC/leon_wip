The reason for such a code -- I really do object to the re-hacking of the main project's (netcpu et al.) code to yield a native 'service' interface for Win(lose) OS with all the (on the other thread) callbacks to start/stop/blah-blah the service... The only thing that is really needed is to start the main process under a given (low-priv.) account -- preiod. So simple in UNIX, and UNIX shall be the main governing factor in the development of the bulk of the code. Any other OS issues shall be solved/remedied/etc. with additional utils (such as this temporary hack) as much as possible. If there shall be more time, then prehaps one shall write a 'wrapper' service process which will simply 'createprocess' for the main application an go no further than that. Currently, just using a 'task' which starts when the computer starts and then lanches the batch file.

In it's essence, this directory represents a quick hack related to the system-admin installation issues on lose OS (which are, indeed, better solved by a specific distribution-on-a-given-OS undertaking). Thusly, at this stage, it is a temporary patch to allow for the deployment of the lose-OS (under)powered boxes in the NetCPU infrastracture.

TODO: Will look into this when the first stage has been open-sourced and more 'native-builds' and tests can take place.

In addition to the censoc_netcpu_update_client.bat
the subdirs of usb_distro/{32,64}/censoc/netcpu
must have  
censoc_netcpu_update_client.exe
and
certificate.pem

The .exe is to be generated as per build/compilation stage; and certificate should be unique as per any given deployment scenario (i.e. not to be shared in "one for all" public context).
